It is extremely interesting and unlike any concept I've seen in games like this before. Very profiessional design in regards to progress as well

Still incredibly intrigued - and love how new mechanics continue being introduced with good pacing between them

The last two levels were the first ones htta really made me think, especially the last one. I like that all the elements are being combined together now, making it rather complicated
