I think its a clever puzzle game centering around a unique gameplay mechanic. Differently alot of room for expansion and more difficult puzzles using other mechanics build upon the main light mechanic! (Like the rotating light source)

Great job, think it could become a pretty good puzzle game on the switch and pc!

Yeah, some really good expanding in terms of the light mechanic, giving it a lot more depth having the color blend in with each other to make new colors!

With that being said the mechanic was abit confusing at times.
From what i got the bridges also make the color blend into something new? 
And also for any people that may not have memorised the different color blends :P
----------------
The game's difficulty is slowly raising and becoming more and more challenging!

Experimenting around the colors also is a great way to learn them and how they combine. Still though i do sometimes find the bridges like yellow or magenta weird as they seem to correspond with many different colors that highlight them, atleast in my experience.
